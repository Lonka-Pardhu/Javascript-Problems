Problem: Array Filter - Remove Even Numbers
You are given an array of integers. Write a function to filter out all the even numbers from the array, returning a new array with only the odd numbers.

Function Signature:
function filterEvenNumbers(numsArr) {
    // Your code here
}

input:
An array containing random numbers (can be both even and odd);

Output:
A new array containing only the odd numbers from the input array.   

Test Case-1:
filterEvenNumbers([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]);
// Expected Output: [1, 3, 5]
// Explanation: Filter out the even numbers (2, 4, 6) and return the array with only the odd numbers (1, 3, 5).


Test Case-2:
filterEvenNumbers([-2, 0, 1, 5, -7]);
// Expected Output: [1, 5, -7]
// Explanation: Filter out the even numbers (-2, 0) and return the array with only the odd numbers (1, 5, -7).


Test Case-3:
filterEvenNumbers([10, 20, 30]);
// Expected Output: []
// Explanation: All numbers are even, so the resulting array is empty.



NOTE:

The order of the elements in the output array should match the order in which they appear in the input array.

If there are no odd numbers in the input array, the function should return an empty array.

You are not required to modify the original array; return a new array with the filtered elements.
