Problem: Array Intersection - Find Common Elements

You are given two arrays of integers. Write a function to find and return the intersection of the two arrays, i.e., the common elements present in both arrays

Function Signature:
function arrCommonEle(arr1, arr2) {
    // Your code here
}

Output:
An array containing the common elements present in both arr1 and arr2.

Test Case-1:
arrCommonEle([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]);
// Expected Output: [3, 4, 5]
// Explanation: The common elements between the two arrays are 3, 4, and 5.


Test Case-2:
arrCommonEle([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]);
// Expected Output: []
// Explanation: There are no common elements between the two arrays.


Test Case-3:
arrCommonEle([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3]);
// Expected Output: [1, 2, 3]
// Explanation: Both arrays are identical, so the common elements are the elements of the arrays themselves.



NOTE:

The order of elements in the output array does not matter.

If there are no common elements, the function should return an empty array.

You are not required to modify the original arrays; return a new array containing the common elements.
